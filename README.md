# Description:
We are using the College Scorecard API to gather data on various colleges. The program we are designing will allow students to input their ACT or SAT scores along with their major of interest and any other needed information. Based on this input, the program will generate a customized list of colleges categorized as reach schools, target schools, and safety schools. These categories are determined by the studentâ€™s academic profile and the best fit for the chosen major, helping students make informed decisions about which colleges to apply to.
